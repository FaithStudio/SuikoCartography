## Description

This is an Android application that allows users to view the world maps from the classic Konami RPG series, Genso Suikoden. Users can use touch gestures to scroll in and out of the world map. In addition, this application features graphics, music, and sound effects from Suikoden I & II, to induce nostalgia for fans of the game.

Suiko Cartography uses the Subsampling Scale Image View library by Dave Morrissey to handle the loading of very large images, as well as touch gestures. Suiko Cartography also utilizes the HX Audio Player library to provide music and sound effects for the application.
